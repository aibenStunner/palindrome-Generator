# palindrome-Generator
A program that generates all sub-strings that are palindromic from the input taken from the user. At the heart of this application Manacherâ€™s Algorithm. Built using the Kivy GUI framework.

## Motivation :seedling:
I was pretty much astonished when I read about the Manacher's algorithm and felt like building something with it. :smile:
